# LocalGPT

LocalGPT is a local-first, privacy-focused chatbot that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for answering user queries. It indexes your documents and uses large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA through Ollama to provide context-aware responses. Qdrant serves as the vector store for efficient similarity search, while LlamaIndex is used for document ingestion and management.
